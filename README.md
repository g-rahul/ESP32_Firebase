# ESP32_Firebase
This project demonstrates IOT enabled monitoring of EV charging station using ESP32. ESP32 is integrated with Google Firebase. This data is interpreted by the user with the help of an Android application designed using Android Studio. Furthermore, with the help of Google Scripts, the data from Firebase is processed to calculate energy consumption and automate invoice generation and mail it to the user.
